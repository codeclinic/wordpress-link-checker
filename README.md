# WordPress Link Checker

[![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2015.svg)]()

Informs you about the status of links occuring in your WordPress blog posts.

## Usage
Download the `check.php` file and put it into the directory of your WordPress installation. Open the script in your web browser:
`http://example.com/check.php`. It will detect your database configuration automagically. After a few minutes you will see a
listing of all your links.
